<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I love taking vacations. Nothing is more important to me than spending quality
  time with family and friends. I always have the best time when i get to vacate
  with my loved ones. We love beaches, going on roller coster rides and zip
  lining to name a few.

  Cooking is another thing i'm very passionate about. I can spend an entire day
  in the kitchen, making different dishes. Thanksgiving is one of my favorite
  days. I usually host thanksgiving at my house and trust me, we have the BEST
  time.
